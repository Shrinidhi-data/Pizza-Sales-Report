## üìà Business Insights

### üîπ **1. Product Strategy**

**a. Popular Categories:**

* **Supreme (25.11%)** and **Classic (27.09%)** are top performers.
* **Veggie (24.37%)** is also close in share, indicating vegetarian options are in demand.
* Consider expanding **Classic and Supreme** variations and creating combo offers.

**b. Best-Selling Pizzas:**

* Focus marketing and bundling around **The Classic Deluxe Pizza**, **The Pepperoni Pizza**, and **The Thai Chicken Pizza**, as they are the **Top 3 by orders**.

---

### üîπ **2. Sizing and Inventory Decisions**

**a. Most Popular Sizes:**

* **Large pizzas (46%)** dominate sales, followed by **Medium (31%)**.
* Only **2% sales for XL size**, suggesting it's not cost-effective to maintain large inventory of XLs.
* Action: Optimize inventory and promotions around **L & M sizes**.

---

### üîπ **3. Pricing Strategy**

**a. Average Order Value (AOV):**

* AOV decreased slightly from \$38 to \$37.
* Consider:

  * Upsell strategies (e.g., drinks, desserts).
  * Bundle deals to increase AOV.

---

### üîπ **4. Peak Sales Timing**

**a. Time of Day:**

* **Afternoon (48%)** and **Evening (38%)** dominate.
* Action:

  * Boost staffing and kitchen resources during these times.
  * Introduce **happy hour deals or promotions during Morning/Night** to drive demand.

**b. Day of Week:**

* **Friday (20%)** sees the highest sales.
* **Sunday and Monday** are the lowest.
* Action:

  * Run weekend combo offers or **early-week discounts** to even out sales.

---

### üîπ **5. Sales & Performance Monitoring**

**a. Month-over-Month Performance:**

* July shows growth in total sales (\$73K vs \$68K), orders, and pizzas sold.
* However, **AOV declined**, which needs addressing.
* Action:

  * Investigate if lower-priced items are being ordered more or if discounts are impacting AOV.

**b. Sales Trend Analysis:**

* **July (\$72.6K)** was one of the top months, followed by **May and March**.
* There‚Äôs a dip in **September and October**‚Äîcould be due to seasonality.
* Action:

  * Plan **seasonal promotions** to counter historically low months.

---

### üîπ **Operational Improvements**

**a. Category vs. Pizza Size Table:**

* **Veggie pizzas** are popular in **M & L sizes**, less in S.
* **Classic pizzas** show good spread across all sizes.
* Action:

  * Tailor production and ingredient procurement based on this size-category pattern.

---

### üîπ **Marketing Strategy**

* Promote high-selling items with **limited-time offers**.
* Consider targeted promotions for underperforming categories (e.g., **XL sizes**, **morning time**).
* Leverage data for **personalized recommendations** based on size and category preferences.
